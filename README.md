# Mesh Data Management

The *Data Mesh* paradigm is a growing movement to employ a set of best
practices for managment of data, at scale, in real enterprise
situations. Rather than a simply a set of technologies, *Data Mesh* is
a set of philosophies which have been honed by practice. It is a
strategic approach to enterprise data managment which has incoporated
many ideas borrowed, both technical and organisationl, from successes
and advancements in multiple different domains.

This introduction will get you started with the tools you will need to
