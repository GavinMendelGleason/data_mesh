# The Philosophy of the Data Mesh

Data mesh is a philosophical approach to overcoming the organisational
and technical problems encountered while doing *data management in the
large*. The philosophy has been honed as a *praxis* in real projects
which have attempted to overcome the [problems of data
management](./Problems.md). We will therefore make frequent references
to these problems and how we solve them.

There are a number of general principles and rules of thumb that we
will repeatedly make reference to, and which we will describe some
techniques to address. Data Mesh is not a technology stack, but it
should give you a map which can help you to choose an effective
technology stack.

## The Data Product

The tech world is rife with stories about Data being the new oil, or
data being the new gold. Data forward organisations are capable of
beating their competition by having better understanding of themselves
and the market allowing them to better cut costs with increased
efficiency and take advantages of opportunities by having more
developed senses of what is going on in the market.

Yet while we talk about data as being critical to the way we do
business, we tend to treat it like it is, in itself, valuable. Data is
*not* gold, and it is *not* oil. It isn't even 24k gold or high-octane
performance refined petrol. These are completely fungible commodities
which simply grow value as their quantity grows.

Data is *nothing* like this at all. Instead, data is a *product*. It
is closer to a BMW or an iphone than it is to oil or gold although
this also stretches the analogy.

What do we mean that data is a product? It means that we have to
carefully assemble our data for the *consumer* to ensure a successful
user-experience. It is a complex assemblage that might require joining
many disparate parts and refining mountains of input data to create
something which exposes the insights which can be operationalised
successfully by your organisation.

## The Domain Team

The Data Mesh approach is essentially *cybernetic* in philosophy in
that Data Mesh views the problems of data management to be fundamentally
technical-organisational.

Data management is done *by* and *for* people, using the tools we have
at our disposal. And because of this how we organise people is an
absolutely critical part of finding solutions.

The core of our approach to solving the problems of data management is
the domain team. We should embrace specialisation and leverage
it. This doesn't mean that we create a marketing team which is 100% MBAs!
Quite the contrary, we need a *cross-functional* domain team, which is
staffed with all of the people which are necessary to carry out the
responsibilities of our unit.

But what *are* the responsibilities of our unit. This is where Data
Mesh comes in: we have to change *what* we do and because of this, we
will have to change *how* we perform and *who* will be in our team.

The domain team, aside from its core function of carrying out the
operational function with which it is tasked, must also build *data products*.
