# The Philosophy of the Data Mesh

Data mesh is a philosophical approach to overcoming the organisational
and technical problems encountered while doing *data management in the
large*. The philosophy has been honed as a *praxis* in real projects
which have attempted to overcome the [problems of data
management](./Problems.md). We will therefore make frequent references
to these problems and how we solve them.

There are a number of general principles and rules of thumb that we
will repeatedly make reference to, and which we will describe some
techniques to address. Data Mesh is not a technology stack, but it
should give you a map which can help you to choose an effective
technology stack.

## The Domain Team

The Data Mesh approach is essentially *cybernetic* in philosophy in
that Data Mesh views the problems of data management to be fundamentally
technical-organisational.

Data management is done *by* and *for* people, using the tools we have
at our disposal. And because of this how we organise people is an
absolutely critical part of finding solutions.

The core of our approach to solving the problems of data management is
the domain team. We should embrace specialisation and leverage
it. This doesn't mean that we create a marketing team which is 100% MBAs!
Quite the contrary, we need a *cross-functional* domain team, which is
staffed with all of the people which are necessary to carry out the
responsibilities of our unit.

But what *are* the responsibilities of our unit. This is where Data
Mesh comes in to tell us that we have to change *what* we do and
because of this, we will have to change *how* we perform and *who*
will be in our team.
